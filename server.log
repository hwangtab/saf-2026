⨯ Error: Image with src "" has "placeholder='blur'" property but is missing the "blurDataURL" property.
        Possible solutions:
          - Add a "blurDataURL" property, the contents should be a small Data URL to represent the image
          - Change the "src" property to a static import with one of the supported file types: jpeg,png,webp,avif (animated images not supported)
          - Remove the "placeholder" property, effectively no blur effect
